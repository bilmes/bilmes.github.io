  abstract = {Recent deep learning models that predict the {Hi-C} contact map from {DNA} sequence achieve promising accuracy but cannot generalize to new cell types and or even capture differences among training cell types. We propose {Epiphany}, a neural network to predict cell-type-specific {Hi-C} contact maps from widely available epigenomic tracks. {Epiphany} uses bidirectional long short-term memory layers to capture long-range dependencies and optionally a generative adversarial network architecture to encourage contact map realism. {Epiphany} shows excellent generalization to held-out chromosomes within and across cell types, yields accurate {TAD} and interaction calls, and predicts structural changes caused by perturbations of epigenomic signals.},
