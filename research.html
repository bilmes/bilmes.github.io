<p>
It may be best to visit my publications page
<a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/bilmes/pgs/class_rescat.html">
sorted by research category</a> to get a feeling for the
research that I do, but some of the recent projects I have
been involved in are briefly summarized below.</p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/gmtk">The
Graphical Models Toolkit (Binaries, Draft Documentation, and a
Tutorial).</a> As of March, 2011, a full new source release and new documentation
are coming soon. This is funded by the NSF, and by gifts
from Intel and Microsoft.
</li>

<li> Discrete optimization and in particular
<a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/ee595a_spring_2011/">submodular
functions</a> applied to machine learning. Submodular functions are a
class of discrete functions that on the one hand are 
powerful, flexible, and applicable to real problems but on the other hand are not too unrestricted
so that hope for efficient algorithms needs to be given up. Submodular functions
capture the notion of diminishing returns (an item is worth or costs
less when it is considered in a larger context).  We have been
developing new and applying existing ideas in submodular functions to
a variety of applications in machine learning. See the
<a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/bilmes/pgs/class_rescat.html#Submodularity">
following page</a> for recent publications on submodularity in machine
learning. Some of this work is now sponsored by a gift from Google.
</li>

<li> Graphical Models and BioInformatics, joint with
<a href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/~noble">
Bill Noble</a>. The application of dynamic graphical models to protein
identification and to genome detection. There are a bunch of ideas
that we are developing using dynamic graphical models, see
the relevant 
<a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/people/bilmes/pgs/class_rescat.html#Bioinformatics">
publications</a>. This is funded by the NIH.
</li>

<li> Novel methods of speech recognition, including articulatory
speech recognition and other aspects of speech are are 
currently under-exploited in existing speech recognition technology.
This also involves dynamic graphical models, and this is
joint work with Karen Livescu. This work is funded by the NSF.
</li>

<li> <a href="http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/vj">The Vocal Joystick</a>
is all about using your voice in non-verbal ways to control computing
devices and electro-mechanical devices. The underlying application is
for individuals with motor impairments and thus who otherwise would be
unable to use a mouse or trackpad. This was funded by the NSF.
</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.companions-project.org/">Companions</a>, A
European project with the goal of developing intelligent "presence"
devices to interact with and help individuals.</li>

<li> Human Like Speech Processing - building new speech recognition
systems by combining statistical modeling and human-like
characteristics. This was funded by ONR.
</li>

<li> Sequential human activity recognition, a series of ongoing
projects with
<a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/fox/">Dieter Fox</a>.
This was funded by DARPA, and now is being funded by Intel.
</li>

<li> Dynamics of Human Social Interaction - designing dynamic models
of the evolution of human social networks in-situ,
with <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tanzeem/"> Tanzeem
Choudhury</a>. This was funded by the NSF. 
</li>

<li> Intransitive Classifiers and Social Choice - producing
methodologies that combine aspects of pattern classification and and
social choice theory in a way that exploits intransitivity,
with 
<a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/mmp">Marina Meila</a>.
This was funded by the NSF. 
</li>
