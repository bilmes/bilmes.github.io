<h2>Students Applying to Graduate School at UW</h2>

<p>
Due to the volume of email I receive from prospective students, I
cannot (and do not) respond personally to questions about admissions.
If you are applying to the UW graduate program, then please read
the <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/admissions/">prospective
student information</a> and contact the EE graduate admissions
assistants at the advising office for any additional questions.  They
are extremely helpful.
</p>

<p>
Here is a set of standard questions and responses to the questions I'm frequently
asked in student emails.
</p>

<p>
<b>I have completed (am completing) my studies at a particular
university and I have received very good marks from my
university. I am very interested in your research. Do you think I
should apply to your department and university? Can you look over
my resume to let me know if I should apply?</b>
</p>

<p>
I am not able to look over your resume. In any event, I do strongly recommend
that you apply to UWEE in all cases. Once we have the applications,
the admissions team looks over every application extremely carefully
and makes final decisions only then. It is not possible to look over
an individual resume and accurately assess admissions.  Please look
over
our <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/admissions/">prospective
student information</a> and contact the EE graduate admissions
assistants (email addresses are
listed <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/admissions/">here</a>) at
the advising office for any additional questions. When in doubt, apply.
</p>


<p>
<b>Do you have positions available for the next academic term?</b>
</p>
<p>
It is quite likely I will, but I never know. Positions come in at unexpected times. In general,
if you want the chance of a position, the best thing is to just apply. I can not look
at your resume to tell you your chances, but if you do not apply, your chances are definitely zero.
</p>



<p>
<b>Can I be your research assistant?</b>
</p>

<p>
I cannot take on a research assistant unless they have already been
admitted to UW.  Admissions decisions are not made by individual
faculty but by the UWEE admissions committee, who set very high
standards on the caliber of students admitted.  After all, you might
end up working with another advisor later in your career.
</p>

<p>
You should also realize that on average, I only take on one or two new
doctoral advisees per year.  I usually select advisees from the pool
of admitted students, after reading their folders and chatting to them
in person.
</p>

<p>
<b>I have funding from an external source, so  I will cost you
nothing.  Can I be your research assistant?</b>
</p>

<p>
Congratulations on receiving external funding!  But you still have to
make it through the admissions committee, which does not consider
external funding as a factor when selecting students.  I also
personally do not consider external funding when selecting graduate
advisees from the pool of admitted students, as quality and
compatibility with my group are my overriding concerns.
</p>

<p>
<b>I can only afford to come to UW if I receive support.  Will I
receive a RA or a TA appointment?</b>
</p>

<p>
It is hard to say, as it depends on many things. The vast majority of
our students ultimately receive full support for the remaining
duration of their graduate career, either as RAs or TAs. Funding
should not be a concern that stops you applying to UW.
</p>

<p>
<b>Can you read my resume to see if I have a chance at UW?</b>
</p>
<p>
Admission to graduate school in the UW EE department is highly
competitive.  The best judge of your chances are the faculty at your
own institution, who should hopefully know you well and can compare
you with other students from your school who were successful in
gaining admission to graduate school.  If in doubt, apply.  You might
also find it useful to contact our
<a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/academic/prospective.html">
advising office</a>
</p>


<p>
Almost all of our applicants have exceptional course grades, and so
these are rarely a factor in admissions.  The most important factor
for admissions is the set of research projects you've been involved
with, and letters of recommendation from your supervisors on those
projects.  If you are reading this before your senior year, then the
single best way to improve your chances of gaining admission to the
our program is to seek out a faculty advisor at your school and work
on an independent undergraduate research project with them.
</p>

<p>
<b>I am interested in graduate school and will be visiting UW, can I
come by to see you and chat about your research?</b>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I am usually too busy myself, but my group will try to
accommodate visitors if you give them sufficient notice and they are
not too busy.  Usually, my graduate students will make time to chat
with you about our research and what graduate school is like here.
Please note that a visit will have absolutely no impact on the
admissions process, so please don't make a special trip solely to try
to improve your chances.
</p>

<h2>Students at UW</h2>

<p>
I always try to respond to students who are already at UW, but it
might take me up to a week or more to get back to you depending on my
schedule.  Please be patient. Why might it take me so long to respond?
Because I have long passed the
<a href="http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=388">email event
horizon</a>.  If it's been a week or so since you have sent me email
and I still have not responded, it might have been that your email was
sent to my spam box (which I do not check). Try sending email again.

<h2>Others Outside of UW</h2>

<b>I would like to do a postdoc or visiting scientist position with
you, do you have any positions open?</b>

<p>
I do work with some postdocs and visiting scientists.</p>

<p>
If you wish to do a postdoc with me, then read the following. If you
already have your own funding, then please just send me email. If you
do not have your own funding, then chances are I already would have
advertised the postdoc position in various places and have 
<a href="events.html">listed it</a> on my home page.  If you do not
see a currently open postdoc position, then I do not have a funded
postdoc position available.
</p>


<p>If you wish to visit for a period of time as a self-funded visiting
scientist or to spend your sabbatical with my group, then please just

issue I mentioned above. Email is a rapidly flowing river, and emails from
individuals I do not know (and even from those I know) sometimes flow
by without me even seeing them until many months later (I apologize
for that).
</p>

<b>I would like to do a summer internship with you, do you have any
positions open?</b>
<p>
I do not in general take on summer interns, unless I am involved in a
research collaboration with your current advisor, in which case we
will have already discussed the possibility.
</p>

<b>I would like to do a summer internship with you, and I have funding
so will work for free.  Can I work with you?</b>
<p>
I do not in general take on summer interns even with their own
funding, unless I am involved in a research collaboration with your
current advisor, in which case we will have already discussed the
possibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>I am currently at another school/company, I will work for you for
free. Can you supervise my research?</b>
</p>
<p>
No. I reserve my time for my students at UW.
