<p>Jeffrey A. Bilmes is a professor at
the <a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu">Department of Electrical
Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.washington.edu">University
of Washington</a>, Seattle Washington. He is also an adjunct professor
in <a href="http://cs.washington.edu">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> and
the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/lingweb/"> department of
Linguistics</a>. Prof. Bilmes is the founder of
the 
<a href="https://melodi.ece.uw.edu">MELODI (MachinE Learning for Optimization and Data Interpretation)</a> lab
here in the department. Bilmes
received his Ph.D. from
the <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu">Computer Science Division</a>
of the department of <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu">Electrical
Engineering and Computer
Science</a>, <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of
  California in Berkeley</a> and a masters degree from
<a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a>.
He was also a researcher at
the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu">International Computer
Science Institute</a>, and a member of
the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/real/index.html">Realization</a> group there.
</p>

<p>
Prof. Bilmes is a 2001 NSF Career award winner, 
a 2002 CRA Digital Government Fellow,
a 2008
<a href="http://www.nae.edu/nae/naehome.nsf/weblinks/CGOZ-7AHRDD?OpenDocument">
NAE Gilbreth Lectureship award recipient</a>,
and a 2012/2013 ISCA Distinguished
Lecturer. Prof. Bilmes was, along with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng">Andrew Ng</a>,
one of the two UAI 
(<a href="http://auai.org/">Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence</a>)
program chairs (2009) and then
the general chair (2010). He was also a workshop chair (2011) and the tutorials chair (2014)
at NIPS/NeurIPS (<a href="http://https://neurips.cc/">Neural Information Processing Systems</a>), and
is a regular senior technical chair at NeurIPS/NIPS since then.
He is currently an action editor for JMLR 
(<a href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/">Journal of Machine Learning Research</a>).
</p>

<p>
Prof. Bilmes's primary interests lie in statistical modeling (particularly
graphical model approaches) and signal processing for pattern
classification, speech recognition, language processing,
bioinformatics, machine learning, submodularity in combinatorial
optimization and machine learning, active and semi-supervised
learning, and audio/music processing. He is particularly interested in
temporal graphical models (or dynamic graphical models, which includes
HMMs, DBNs, and CRFs) and ways in which to design efficient algorithms
for them and design their structure so that they may perform as better
structured classifiers.  He also has strong interests in speech-based
human-computer interfaces, the statistical properties of natural
objects and natural scenes, information theory and its relation to
natural computation by humans and pattern recognition by machines, and
computational music processing (such as human timing subtleties).  He
is also quite interested in high performance computing systems,
computer architecture, and software techniques to reduce power
consumption.
</p>

<p>
Prof. Bilmes has also pioneered (starting in 2003) the development of
submodularity within machine learning, and he received a <b>best paper
  award at ICML 2013</b> and a <b>best paper award at NIPS 2013</b> in
this area.  In 2014, Prof. Bilmes also received a <b> most influential paper
  in 25 years award</b> from the International Conference on
Supercomputing, given to a paper on high-performance matrix
optimization.  Prof. Bilmes has authored the graphical models toolkit
(GMTK), a dynamic graphical-model based software system widely used in
speech, language, bioinformatics, and human-activity recognition.
