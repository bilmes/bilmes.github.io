	abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry data acquired using data independent acquisition (DIA) is challenging to interpret because the data exhibits complex structure along both the mass-to-charge (m/z) and time axes. The most common approach to analyzing this type of data makes use of a library of previously observed DIA data patterns (a {\textquotedblleft}spectral library{\textquotedblright}), but this approach is expensive because the libraries do not typically generalize well across laboratories. Here we propose DIAmeter, a search engine that detects peptides in DIA data using only a peptide sequence database. Unlike other library-free DIA analysis methods, DIAmeter supports data generated using both wide and narrow isolation windows, can readily detect peptides containing post-translational modifications, can analyze data from a variety of instrument platforms, and is capable of detecting peptides even in the absence of detectable signal in the survey (MS1) scan.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
